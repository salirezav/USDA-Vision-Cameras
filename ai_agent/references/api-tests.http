### RECORDING TESTS
### Note: All filenames will automatically have datetime prefix added
### Format: YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_filename.avi (or auto-generated if no filename)
###
### FPS Behavior:
### - fps > 0: Capture at specified frame rate
### - fps = 0: Capture at MAXIMUM possible speed (no delay between frames)
### - fps omitted: Uses camera config default (usually 3.0 fps)
### - Video files saved with 30 FPS metadata when fps=0 for proper playback

### CAMERA RECOVERY AND DIAGNOSTICS TESTS
###
### These endpoints help recover cameras that have failed to initialize or lost connection.
###
### Recovery Methods (in order of severity):
### 1. test-connection: Test if camera connection is working
### 2. reconnect: Soft reconnection using CameraReConnect()
### 3. restart-grab: Restart grab process using CameraRestartGrab()
### 4. reset-timestamp: Reset camera timestamp using CameraRstTimeStamp()
### 5. full-reset: Hard reset - uninitialize and reinitialize camera
### 6. reinitialize: Complete reinitialization for cameras that never initialized
###
### Recommended troubleshooting order:
### 1. Start with test-connection to diagnose the issue
### 2. Try reconnect first (most common fix)
### 3. If reconnect fails, try restart-grab
### 4. If still failing, try full-reset
### 5. Use reinitialize only for cameras that failed initial setup
###

### RECOVERY WORKFLOW EXAMPLES
###

### Example 1: Basic troubleshooting workflow for camera1
### Step 1: Test connection
POST http://localhost:8000/cameras/camera1/test-connection

### Step 2: If test fails, try reconnect
# POST http://localhost:8000/cameras/camera1/reconnect

### Step 3: If reconnect fails, try restart grab
# POST http://localhost:8000/cameras/camera1/restart-grab

### Step 4: If still failing, try full reset
# POST http://localhost:8000/cameras/camera1/full-reset

### Step 5: If camera never initialized, try reinitialize
# POST http://localhost:8000/cameras/camera1/reinitialize

###

### Example 2: Quick recovery sequence for camera2
### Try reconnect first (most common fix)
POST http://localhost:8000/cameras/camera2/reconnect

### If that doesn't work, try full reset
